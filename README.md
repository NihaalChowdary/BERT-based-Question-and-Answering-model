## Introduction

This project involves a BERT-based question and answering model that has been fine-tuned on the SQuADv2 dataset. The model leverages the powerful BERT architecture to provide accurate answers to questions based on given contexts. The SQuADv2 dataset includes questions that may or may not have an answer in the context, adding an additional layer of complexity and realism to the task.

## Features

- Fine-tuned distl-BERT model for question answering.
- Trained on the SQuADv2 dataset.
- Handles questions that may not have answers in the provided context.
