Before we can feed those texts to our model, we need to preprocess them. This is done by a ðŸ¤— Transformers `Tokenizer` which will (as the name indicates) tokenize the inputs (including converting the tokens to their corresponding IDs in the pretrained vocabulary) and put it in a format the model expects, as well as generate the other inputs that model requires.

To do all of this, we instantiate our tokenizer with the `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained` method, which will ensure:

- we get a tokenizer that corresponds to the model architecture we want to use,
- we download the vocabulary used when pretraining this specific checkpoint.

That vocabulary will be cached, so it's not downloaded again the next time we run the cell.

Now one specific thing for the preprocessing in question answering is how to deal with very long documents. We usually truncate them in other tasks, when they are longer than the model maximum sentence length, but here, removing part of the the context might result in losing the answer we are looking for. To deal with this, we will allow one (long) example in our dataset to give several input features, each of length shorter than the maximum length of the model (or the one we set as a hyper-parameter).

For instance, it will properly detect if you change the task in the first cell and rerun the notebook. ðŸ¤— Datasets warns you when it uses cached files, you can pass `load_from_cache_file=False` in the call to `map` to not use the cached files and force the preprocessing to be applied again.

## Fine-tuning the model

Now that our data is ready for training, we can download the pretrained model and fine-tune it. Since our task is question answering, we use the `TFAutoModelForQuestionAnswering` class. Like with the tokenizer, the `from_pretrained` method will download and cache the model for us:

To train our model, we will need to define a few more things.

Remove the two of them if you didn't follow the installation steps at the top of the notebook, otherwise you can change the value of `push_to_hub_model_id` to something you would prefer.

We also tweak the learning rate, use the `batch_size` defined at the top of the notebook and customize the number of epochs for training, as well as the weight decay.

The built-in loss will also correctly handle things like masking the loss on padding tokens, or unlabelled tokens in the case of masked language modelling, so we recommend using it unless you're an advanced user!

In addition, because the outputs and loss for this model class are quite straightforward, we can use built-in Keras metrics - these are liable to misbehave in other contexts (for example, they don't know about the masking in masked language modelling) but work well here.

We can also use `jit_compile` to compile the model with [XLA](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla). In other cases, we should be careful about that - if our inputs might have variable sequence lengths, we may end up having to do a new XLA compilation for each possible length, because XLA compilation expects a static input shape!

When one example gives several features, we have to predict the impossible answer when all the features give a high score to the impossible answer (since one feature could predict the impossible answer just because the answer isn't in the part of the context it has access too), which is why the score of the impossible answer for one example is the *minimum* of the scores for the impossible answer in each feature generated by the example.
